The dataset covers worldwide production of phosphate rock (PR) at the level of phosphate mining and beneficiation complex. The objective is to gather complex-specific data on the P content of mined and beneficiated resource and on the recovery rates of beneficiation process. Phosphate mining and beneficiation complex refers to a phosphate ore deposit with adjacent mine(s) and beneficiation plant(s). See [Introduction](R/phosphateRock/vignettes/Introduction.pdf) for details.

The dataset is structured into 7 tables. 

All tables can be accessed using the [R package phosphateRock](R/phosphateRock) and using the [CSV files](CSV/phosphateRock).
