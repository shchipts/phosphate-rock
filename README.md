# Global dataset on phosphate mining and beneficiation

The dataset covers worldwide production of phosphate rock (PR) at the level of phosphate mining and beneficiation complex. The objective is to gather complex-specific data on the P content of mined and beneficiated resource and on the recovery rates of beneficiation process. Phosphate mining and beneficiation complex refers to a phosphate ore deposit with adjacent mine(s) and beneficiation plant(s).

The dataset is structured into 7 tables. All tables can be accessed using R package [phosphateRock](R/phosphateRock) and using the [CSV files](CSV/phosphateRock).

See [Introduction](R/phosphateRock/vignettes/Introduction.pdf) for details.
